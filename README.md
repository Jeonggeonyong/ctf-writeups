# CTF Write-ups

Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) write-up repository!  
Here you'll find detailed write-ups, analysis, and notes from CTF challenges Iâ€™ve solved.  
## Conventions

- Folder names follow `YEAR-CTFName` format
- Write-up filenames use the challenge name (e.g., `web1.md`)
- Resources folder contains reusable notes, templates, and images
## Note

Some problem files may not be included due to copyright or CTF rules.  
Only public or permitted content will be shared.

Happy Hacking! :)
